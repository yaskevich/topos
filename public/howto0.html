                To search via <b>Russian spelling</b>, enter into search field either full place name, or its segment.
                Keep in mind, that Russian orthography does not reflect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akanye"
                    target="_blank">akanye</a>, that's why it's more related to etymology. So, <i>Абра́мава</i> and
                <i>Абрамо́ва</i> do differ in Belarusian, but they look the same in Russian.

                Keep in mind that the data for that visualization are mostly taken from open sources that are compiled
                automatcially and/or fixed/completed by volunteers. The state does not publish relevant information in
                machine-readable form. That's why the dataset can contain orthographic mistakes, translation issues;
                some existing place can be absent, be duplicated or not georeferenced.

                E.g., searching for suffix of the so called „Safarewicz border“ (the territory inhabited in ancient
                times by Baltic tribes) by means of the query -<i>shki</i> outputs both <i>Антонішкі</i> (<span
                    style="color: green">OK</span>) and <i>Шышкі</i> (<span style="color: red">error!</span>). It is
                more complicated with
                <b>semantics</b>: e.g., searching for radices related to 'red' (Standard Russian
                <i>&#8209;красн&#8209;</i>
                vs Standard Belarusian <i>&#8209;чырвон&#8209;</i>) does not guarantee that all they are results of
                Soviet politics. Many units are older than Soviet or even ancient Belarusian names.
